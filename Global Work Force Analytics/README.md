# Global Workforce Analytics Dashboard

### Project Overview
This dashboard was developed to provide a comprehensive analysis of global workforce data, offering key insights into employee demographics, hiring trends, salary distribution, and attrition rates. It serves as a valuable tool for HR professionals, department managers, and business leaders to make data-driven decisions regarding talent management and strategy.

### Objectives
- To monitor and visualize key workforce KPIs such as total employees, average salary, and attrition rate.
- To analyze hiring and growth trends over time.
- To compare average salaries and attrition rates across different departments.
- To visualize the geographical distribution of the workforce and the breakdown of work modes (On-site vs. Remote).
- To identify potential areas of concern, such as high-attrition departments, that require further investigation.

### Key Insights
- **Workforce Size:** The company has a total of 2 million employees, with an average salary of $896,888.
- **Attrition Rate:** The overall attrition rate is 20%, indicating a significant portion of employees leaving the company.
- **Salary Distribution:** The IT department has the highest average salary, followed by Finance and R&D.
- **Work Mode:** The workforce is primarily On-site (60%), with a substantial 40% of employees working remotely.
- **Attrition Hotspot:** The IT department shows the highest number of employee attrition, a finding that requires immediate attention and deeper analysis.

### Impact & Recommendations
Based on the insights gained from this analysis, here are the key impacts and actionable recommendations for stakeholders:

- ### For HR & Department Managers:
### Recommendation
Conduct a root-cause analysis into why the IT and Sales departments have the highest attrition.
### Impact 
This can lead to the development of targeted retention strategies, such as improving compensation or providing better career growth opportunities, ultimately lowering turnover and saving recruitment costs.

- ### For Talent Acquisition Teams:
### Recommendation
Actively promote the company's flexible work model, which currently includes 40% of employees working remotely.
### Impact
This strategy can significantly broaden the talent pool, allowing you to attract and hire qualified candidates from a wider range of locations, reducing time-to-hire for key roles.

- ### For Business Leaders & Executives:
### Recommendation
Use the trend data, such as the peak in hiring in 2022, to inform future workforce planning and budget allocation.
### Impact
By understanding past hiring cycles and current salary trends, leadership can make more informed decisions about strategic investments, ensuring competitive compensation and aligning staffing with business goals.

### Methodology
The data for this project was sourced from a publicly available dataset. I used SQL and Power BI to perform the analysis. The process was as follows:

**Data Cleaning and Transformation (SQL):** I used SQL to perform a thorough data cleaning process. This included checking for and handling missing values, duplicates, and nulls. I also removed columns that were not necessary for the analysis.

**Data Visualization and DAX Measures (Power BI):** After cleaning the data in SQL, I imported the refined dataset into Power BI. I created several key DAX measures for critical metrics like total employees, active employees, and attrition rate. I then used these measures to design a series of interactive charts and graphs to visualize key trends and insights.

**Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates my ability to use industry-standard tools like SQL and Power BI to transform raw data into a clear and actionable dashboard. By analyzing key workforce metrics, I was able to identify critical insights into employee demographics, salary, and attrition. This dashboard serves as a powerful example of how data can be used to inform business decisions and drive strategic change.

Moving forward, this project could be enhanced by connecting to a live database for real-time data updates, incorporating more advanced predictive analytics to forecast future attrition, or building a more detailed analysis on specific departments.
