- Evaluate salary ranges and outliers to assess pay equity and executive compensation.
- Provide HR leaders with attrition and workforce health insights.


### Key Insights
- Workforce Size : The organization employs over 2M employees, distributed globally.
- Employment Status : The majority are Active employees, with a smaller share resigned, retired, or terminated.
