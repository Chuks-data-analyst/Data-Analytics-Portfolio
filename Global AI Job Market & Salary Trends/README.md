#  Global AI Job Market Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
This interactive dashboard explores global AI job market dynamics**, focusing on job postings, salary insights, and skill demand across industries and regions. By consolidating hiring data, it empowers recruiters, job seekers, and business leaders** with actionable insights into workforce trends, high-paying locations, and the most in-demand AI roles and skills.  


## Problem Statement  
The rapid expansion of AI adoption worldwide has created a surge in demand for skilled professionals. However, navigating this fast-changing job market is challenging due to fragmented data on salaries, roles, skills, and geographic demand**. Without centralized insights, recruiters struggle to target high-potential markets, while job seekers lack visibility into the best-paying locations and most in-demand skills. A data-driven solution is needed to bridge this gap and support smarter career and hiring decisions.  

##  Objectives  
- **Monitor Job Market KPIs**: Track total job postings, average salaries, and hiring locations.  
- **Identify In-Demand Skills**: Highlight the most requested AI skills and high-paying roles.  
- **Compare Salary Variations**: Analyze pay differences across countries and work settings (On-site, Hybrid, Remote).  
- **Track Posting Trends**: Detect seasonal patterns in job postings to understand hiring cycles.  
- **Spot Geographic Hotspots**: Identify countries leading AI job creation to support career planning and recruitment strategies.  


##  Key Insights  
- **AI Skill Demand**: Python is the top skill (4,450 postings), followed by SQL (3,407) and Kubernetes (3,009).  
- **Salary Benchmarks**: Switzerland records the highest average annual salary ($170,639), ahead of Denmark ($165,652) and Norway ($159,491).  
- **Work Location Trends**: Job postings are nearly evenly split across On-site (5,075), Hybrid (5,005), and Remote (4,920) roles, underscoring flexibility in AI hiring.  
- **Role-Based Salaries**: AI Specialists earn the highest average salary ($120,571), with AI Architects and Research Scientists close behind (~$117K).  
- **Geographic Hotspots**: Germany leads hiring demand (814 postings), followed by France, Denmark, Canada, and Austria.  
- **Posting Trends**: Job postings peaked in April (1,927) before declining mid-year, suggesting seasonality in AI recruitment cycles.  



##  Impact & Recommendations  

### For Recruiters & Hiring Managers
