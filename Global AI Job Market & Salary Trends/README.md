### Global AI Job Market Dashboard

### Project Overview
This interactive dashboard was designed to explore global AI job market dynamics, focusing on job postings, salary insights, and skill demand across industries and regions. By consolidating hiring data, it empowers recruiters, job seekers, and business leaders with actionable insights into workforce trends, high-paying locations, and the most in-demand AI roles and skills


### Objectives
- Monitor and visualize key job market KPIs such as total postings, average salary, and number of hiring locations.
- Identify the most in-demand AI skills and high-paying roles.
- Compare salary variations across countries and work locations (On-site, Hybrid, Remote).
- Track monthly posting trends to detect hiring cycles and seasonal patterns.
- Highlight leading countries in AI job opportunities to support career and hiring strategies.


### Key Insights
- AI Skill Demand – Python leads as the most in-demand AI skill (4,450 postings), followed by SQL (3,407) and Kubernetes (3,009).
- Salary Benchmarks – Switzerland records the highest average annual salary ($170,639), surpassing Denmark ($165,652) and Norway ($159,491).
- Work Location Trends – Job postings are almost evenly split across On-site (5,075), Hybrid (5,005), and Fully Remote (4,920) roles, highlighting flexible work adoption in AI.
- Role-Based Salaries – AI Specialists earn the highest average salary ($120,571), while AI Architects and Research Scientists earn around $117k annually.
- Geographic Hotspots – Germany emerges as the top hiring hub (814 postings), with strong demand also seen in France, Denmark, Canada, and Austria.
- Posting Trends – Job postings peak in April (1,927) before declining mid-year, suggesting seasonality in AI recruitment cycles.

Based on the insights gained from this analysis, here are the key impacts and actionable recommendations for stakeholders:
### Recommendation 
- Focus on Germany, France, and Denmark as primary markets for hiring given the high volume of job postings.

### Impact 
- This focus can streamline recruitment efforts, reduce time-to-hire, and attract a larger pool of qualified candidates from leading AI markets.

### Recommendation
- Consider Switzerland, Denmark, and Norway as top destinations for high-paying roles. Additionally, highlight skills like Python, SQL, and Kubernetes on your resume, as they are most in-demand.

### Impact
- Following these recommendations can lead to a more targeted job search, resulting in higher earning potential and a faster path to securing a role.

### Recommendation
- Given the almost even split between On-site, Hybrid, and Remote roles, consider a flexible work policy to attract top talent from a global pool.

### Impact
- Adopting a flexible model can significantly broaden your talent reach beyond local markets and improve employee satisfaction and retention.

### Methodology
The data for this project was sourced from a public dataset on Kaggle. The entire analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. 
### The process involved several key steps:
**Data Cleaning:** The raw data was imported into Excel. I performed a thorough data cleaning process, which included checking for and handling missing values, duplicates, and nulls. I also renamed columns for clarity, replaced text values, and removed columns that were not relevant to the analysis.
**Data Transformation:** I used Excel's pivot tables to perform data transformation, including calculating average salaries, counting job postings by location and skill, and categorizing roles to enable deeper analysis.
**Visualization:** I created a series of interactive charts and graphs to visualize key trends. These visualizations were designed to make complex data easy to understand, providing a clear overview of the global AI job market.

### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how data analytics, even with a common tool like Excel, can be used to extract powerful, actionable insights from raw data. By creating this dashboard, I've not only answered key questions about the AI job market but also provided a clear, visual resource for stakeholders. This project reinforced my skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
