# üè• Hospital Management Dashboard

##  Project Overview  
This project delivers an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that consolidates hospital data into a single source of truth. It provides visibility into **revenue, patient appointments, treatment trends, and demographics**. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard enables hospital administrators and managers to **monitor performance, optimize resources, and make data-driven decisions** that improve both operational efficiency and patient care.  


##  Problem Statement  
Hospitals often struggle to monitor key operational and financial metrics due to fragmented data and limited visibility. Without a centralized system, administrators face challenges in **tracking revenue trends, understanding appointment outcomes, and identifying high-demand specializations**. These gaps hinder their ability to **optimize resources, reduce no-show rates, and improve both financial stability and patient care**.  



##  Objectives  
- **Monitor Key KPIs**: Track revenue, patient volumes, and appointment completion rates.  
- **Identify Trends**: Analyze monthly revenue and patient registrations to uncover seasonal patterns.  
- **Assess Service Demand**: Visualize appointments by specialization and treatment type to guide staffing.  
- **Evaluate Appointment Outcomes**: Measure completion, cancellation, and no-show rates to improve engagement.  
- **Understand Patient Demographics**: Explore age and gender distributions to inform targeted outreach.  



##  Key Insights  
- **Financial Performance**: Generated **$173,425 in revenue** across 200 appointments and 50 patients, with significant month-to-month fluctuations.  
- **Appointment Trends**: Appointment volume peaked in **September**, revealing seasonality that could inform scheduling and marketing.  
- **Service Demand**: **Pediatrics, Dermatology, and Oncology** accounted for 100% of appointments, indicating concentrated demand.  
- **Treatment Insights**: **X-Ray and MRI** were the highest revenue drivers, while **Chemotherapy and Physiotherapy** saw higher patient counts.  
- **Patient Engagement**: High numbers of **no-shows (52)** and **cancellations (51)** indicate communication and retention challenges.  



##  Impact & Recommendations  

### For Hospital Administrators  
- **Recommendation**: Implement automated reminders and follow-ups for cancelled or missed appointments.  
- **Impact**: Improves appointment completion rates, reduces revenue loss, and optimizes staff utilization.  

### For Department Heads  
- **Recommendation**: Allocate staff and resources to **Chemotherapy** and **Physiotherapy** to meet high demand.  
- **Impact**: Reduces wait times, improves care quality, and enhances patient satisfaction.  

### For Marketing & Patient Relations  
- **Recommendation**: Launch targeted campaigns to attract underrepresented demographics (only **38% female** patients).  
- **Impact**: Expands patient base, balances demographics, and drives revenue growth.  


##  Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning**: Verified data integrity using Power Query, ensuring no missing values.  
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between appointments, patients, treatments, doctors, and billing; created DAX measures for KPIs.  
- **Visualization**: Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with charts, tables, and filters for performance monitoring.
