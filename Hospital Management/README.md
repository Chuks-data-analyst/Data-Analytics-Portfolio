### Hospital Management 
### Project Overview
This interactive dashboard was developed to provide a comprehensive overview of a hospital's key performance metrics. By visualizing data on revenue, patient appointments, and treatment trends, it serves as a valuable tool for hospital administrators and managers to make data-driven decisions regarding operations, resource allocation, and patient care.

### Objectives
- To track and monitor key financial and operational KPIs such as total revenue, total patients, and appointment completion rates.
- To analyze monthly revenue and patient registration trends to identify seasonal patterns or a need for marketing strategies.
- To visualize the distribution of appointments by doctor's specialization and treatment type.
- To provide insights into appointment outcomes (Scheduled, Completed, No-Show, Cancelled) and patient demographics.

### Key Insights
- **Financial Performance:** The hospital has a total revenue of $173,425, with 200 total appointments and 50 registered patients.
- **Appointment Trends:** Appointment volume and revenue show significant monthly fluctuations, with a peak in September.
- **Specialization Demand:** Pediatrics, Dermatology, and Oncology are the most in-demand specializations, accounting for a combined 100% of the appointments.
- **Treatment Type:** X-Ray and MRI treatments generate the highest revenue, while Chemotherapy and Physiotherapy have a high patient count.
- **Appointment Outcomes:** A notable number of appointments were either No-Show (52) or Cancelled (51), indicating an opportunity to improve patient retention and communication.

### Impact & Recommendations
Based on the insights gained from this analysis, here are the key impacts and actionable recommendations for stakeholders:

**Recommendation:** Implement a reminder system for patient appointments, and consider a follow-up process for those who cancel or no-show.
**Impact:** This could significantly improve the appointment completion rate, optimize resource allocation, and increase overall revenue by reducing missed appointments.

**Recommendation:** Given the high patient count for Chemotherapy and Physiotherapy, ensure these departments are adequately staffed and resourced to handle demand.
**Impact:** This will improve patient satisfaction, reduce wait times, and ensure a high quality of care, which is crucial for these recurring treatments.

**Recommendation:** Analyze the gender ratio of registered patients (62% male, 38% female) to identify and target underrepresented patient demographics.
**Impact:** A targeted marketing campaign could increase new patient registrations, leading to a more balanced patient base and higher revenue.

### Methodology
The data for this project was sourced from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle. I used Power BI to perform the entire analysis. The process involved several key steps:
- **Data Cleaning:** The raw data was imported into Power BI's Power Query Editor. I checked for missing values,duplicates ensuring the dataset was accurate and reliable before proceeding with the analysis.
- **Data Modeling and Analysis:** I created a data model to establish relationships between different tables (appointments, patients, treatments, doctors, and billing). This relational model, combined with key DAX measures to calculate metrics like Appointment Completion Rate, age, and age groups, provided a robust foundation for the dashboard's insights.
- **Visualization:** I designed a series of interactive charts and graphs to visualize key trends. These visualizations were created to make complex data easy to understand, providing a clear overview of hospital operations.

### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates my ability to use Power BI to transform raw data into a clear and actionable dashboard. By analyzing key hospital metrics, I was able to identify critical insights into operational performance, patient trends, and revenue streams. This dashboard serves as a powerful example of how data can be used to inform business decisions and drive strategic improvements in a healthcare setting.
